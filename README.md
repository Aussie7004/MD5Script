# MD5Script
A short script I made that resolves the MD5 hash of a file.

This script gets any VALID filepath (including OneDrive filepaths) that are stored on your computer and resolves the MD5 Hash from within the file.

Inspiration for this project was the dominant use of Powershell in my current employment position as well as my aspirations of being a Cyber Security Specialist.

This tool can be used to gain insight into a specific malware sample, malicious or suspicious file or be used to uniquely identify and reference a malicious artifact.

I have plans to advance this code, but this is my first powershell script so I still got a bit of learning to go :)
